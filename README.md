## 2. Foundational Knowledge & Skills

This section outlines the fundamental concepts and skills required for success in the Data Science (Analytical) role at Meta.

### Statistics & Probability

Statistics is the foundation of data analysis at Meta. You'll be expected to apply statistical methods to solve real-world product problems.  It's not just about memorizing formulas; it's about *understanding and applying* these concepts to drive product decisions.

**Scenario-Based Interview Questions (Examples):**

*   \"How would you design an A/B test to measure the impact of a new feature on user engagement?\"
*   \"Explain p-value and its limitations in the context of A/B testing at scale.\"
*   \"How would you choose between different regression models for predicting user engagement?\"
*   \"Describe a situation where you used statistical analysis to identify a product opportunity or solve a business problem.\"
*  \"A product manager observes a decrease in DAU. How would you use statistics to investigate the potential causes?\"

#### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.  Knowing *when* to use each statistic is crucial in a business context:

*   **Mean:** The average value.  Useful for summarizing data that is relatively symmetrically distributed, *but sensitive to outliers*.  In social media, it's often less useful than the median for metrics like session duration due to skewness. Formula: μ = Σx / n
*   **Median:** The middle value when the data is ordered. *Less sensitive to outliers than the mean*. Useful for skewed data like user spending or engagement time.  If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
*   **Mode:** The most frequent value. Useful for identifying the most common category or value.  A dataset can have multiple modes or no mode at all.
*   **Variance:** The average of the squared differences from the mean. Measures the spread of the data. Formula: σ² = Σ(x - μ)² / n
*   **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance. Represents the typical deviation from the mean.  *Important for monitoring metric stability and understanding the variability of data*. Formula: σ = √σ²

**Wikipedia:** [Descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  You have website session durations (in seconds): 10, 15, 20, 20, 25, 30, 60. Calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.  *Which measure is most representative of the \"typical\" session duration, and why?*
2.  A product has daily active users (DAU) for a week: 1000, 1200, 1100, 1300, 1050, 950, 1150. Calculate the average DAU and the standard deviation. What does the standard deviation tell you about the *stability* of DAU?
3.  Explain how outliers can affect the mean and median. Provide a *social media-specific* example. (e.g., a single viral post drastically increasing the average number of likes for a user.)

#### 2. Probability Distributions

Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random event.  Understanding these distributions is crucial for modeling user behavior and performing statistical inference.

**Key Theorems:**

*   **Law of Large Numbers (LLN):**  As the number of trials in an experiment increases, the average of the results will converge to the expected value.  *Larger sample sizes in A/B testing lead to more reliable results.*
*   **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** The distribution of *sample means* will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the original population distribution, as the sample size increases. *This is *critical* for A/B testing at Meta.*

**Key Distributions & Social Media Context:**

*   **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):** A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution.
    *   **Crucial Point for Meta:**  While many natural phenomena are normally distributed, *raw user engagement metrics on social media platforms (likes, comments, shares, session duration) are generally *NOT* normally distributed.*  They tend to be highly skewed (power-law, log-normal, etc.).
    *   **The Importance of CLT:** The normal distribution is essential because of the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**.  When we conduct A/B tests, we often compare the *means* of engagement metrics (e.g., average session duration) between two groups.  *Even if the individual user engagement times are skewed, the distribution of the *difference* in sample means will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size increases (due to the CLT).* This is what allows us to use t-tests or z-tests to determine statistical significance.
    *   **Skewness:** Measures asymmetry.  Social media metrics often exhibit *positive skew* (long tail to the right). This impacts the choice of statistical tests and metrics (median often preferred over mean).
*   **Binomial Distribution:** Describes the probability of a specific number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials (e.g., success/failure, click/no click).
    *   **Use Cases:** Modeling conversion rates (e.g., the probability of a user clicking on an ad), analyzing A/B test outcomes (e.g., is the conversion rate difference statistically significant?).
*   **Poisson Distribution:** Describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space (events occur with a known average rate and independently).
    *   **Use Cases:** Modeling the number of posts per hour, messages sent per minute, or support tickets per day.
* **Power Law/Pareto Distribution (Long Tail):** Many social media metrics follow a power-law distribution, where a small percentage of users generate a large proportion of the activity (e.g., a few influencers have a massive number of followers, while most users have relatively few).  *This means the mean is heavily influenced by outliers, and the median or percentiles are often more informative.*

**Wikipedia:** [Probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution), [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), [Binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution), [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), [Power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips? (Binomial)
2.  A website receives an average of 10 visits per hour. What is the probability of receiving exactly 15 visits in an hour? (Poisson)
3.  Explain the Central Limit Theorem and *why it's crucial for A/B testing at Meta*, even if user engagement metrics are not normally distributed.
4.  Why is the median often a better measure of \"typical\" user engagement on social media platforms than the mean? (Relate to skewed distributions)

#### 3. Hypothesis Testing & A/B Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to determine if there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis (a statement of no effect). *A/B testing is the primary application of hypothesis testing at Meta.*

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Null Hypothesis (H0):**  The statement of no effect (e.g., \"The new feature has no impact on click-through rate\").
*   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha):** The statement we are trying to find evidence for (e.g., \"The new feature *increases* click-through rate\").  Can be one-sided or two-sided.
*   **p-value:** The probability of observing the data (or more extreme data) if the null hypothesis is true.  A small p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis.  *At Meta, p-values are interpreted in the context of very large sample sizes, where even small effects can be statistically significant.*
*   **Confidence Interval:** A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).  *Provides a range of plausible effect sizes.*
*   **Statistical Power:** The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (avoiding a Type II error). Power is influenced by sample size, effect size, and significance level (alpha). *Higher power means a lower chance of missing a real effect.*
*   **Type I Error (False Positive):** Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
*   **Type II Error (False Negative):** Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.
*   **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** The smallest effect size that an A/B test is designed to detect with a given level of power.

**A/B Testing at Scale - Practical Considerations:**

*   **Sample Size Calculation:**  Crucial to determine the necessary sample size to achieve sufficient statistical power. Use online calculators (e.g., Optimizely's, Evan Miller's) and understand the inputs: power, alpha, MDE, baseline metric variability.
*   **Multiple Testing Problem:** When conducting many A/B tests simultaneously, the chance of false positives increases.  Briefly mention corrections like Bonferroni or FDR (False Discovery Rate) control.
*   **Experiment Duration and Ramp-Up:**  How long should an experiment run?  Consider seasonality, day-of-week effects, and time to reach steady state.  Ramping up exposure gradually can mitigate risks.
*   **Practical vs. Statistical Significance:**  Even a statistically significant result might not be practically meaningful.  Consider the *magnitude* of the effect and its business impact.
*   **Guardrail Metrics and Counter Metrics:**  Monitor metrics *other than* the primary metric being tested to ensure the new feature isn't negatively impacting other aspects of the user experience (e.g., increased engagement but also increased user reports).
*   **Network Effects:** User interactions can affect other users.

**Wikipedia:** [Hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis_testing), [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), [P-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), [Confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval), [Statistical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  Explain the difference between a Type I and Type II error in A/B testing. Provide a social media-specific example of each.
2.  You conduct an A/B test and get a p-value of 0.03. What does this mean *in practical terms* for a product manager deciding whether to launch a feature?
3.  What are the key inputs to a sample size calculation for an A/B test?  How does increasing the desired power affect the required sample size?
4.  What is the difference between statistical significance and practical significance?
5.  Explain how network effects can complicate A/B testing on a social media platform.

#### 4. Regression Analysis

Regression analysis models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

*   **Linear Regression:**  Dependent variable is continuous. Models a linear relationship (y = mx + b + ...).
    *   **Use Cases:** Modeling the relationship between ad spend and revenue, or time spent on platform and number of friends.
    *   **Assumptions:** Linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), normality of residuals.
    *   **Model Evaluation:** R-squared (proportion of variance explained), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error - measures the average magnitude of errors). Lower RMSE = better fit.
    *   **Coefficient Interpretation:** The change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, *holding all other variables constant.*
*   **Logistic Regression:** Dependent variable is categorical (binary: click/no click, churn/no churn). Models the *probability* of the outcome using a sigmoid function.
    *   **Use Cases:** Predicting whether a user will click on an ad, predicting user churn.
    * **Model Evaluation**: AUC, Log Loss.

**Wikipedia:** [Regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis), [Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), [Logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  When would you use linear regression versus logistic regression? Give examples relevant to Meta.
2.  How do you interpret the coefficients in a linear regression model *in a way that a non-technical product manager would understand*?
3.  What are R-squared and RMSE?  How do you use them to evaluate a linear regression model?
4.  What are some of the key assumptions of linear regression, and why are they important?

#### 5. Experimental Design

Designing sound experiments is crucial for drawing causal inferences.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Randomization:**  Randomly assigning users to different groups (treatment and control) minimizes bias and ensures groups are comparable.  *Essential for establishing causality.*
*   **Control Group:**  A group that does *not* receive the treatment.  Serves as a baseline for comparison.
*   **Treatment Group:**  The group that receives the treatment (e.g., the new feature).
*   **Confounding Variables:**  Variables correlated with both the independent and dependent variables.  Randomization helps to control for these.
* **Practical Challenges at Scale:**
    *   **Network Effects and Interference:** Users are interconnected on social media.  The treatment applied to one user can affect other users, violating the assumption of independence.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Cluster randomization (randomize at the level of groups or communities), egocentric randomization (consider the networks around treated users), graph cluster randomization.
    *   **Clustering of Users:** Users tend to cluster with similar users, leading to non-independence within groups.
    *   **Spillover Effects:**  The treatment \"spills over\" to the control group through user interactions.
    *   **Ethical Considerations:**  Ensuring user privacy and minimizing potential harm.

* **Experiment Types Beyond Basic A/B:**
        *   **Factorial designs.**
        *   **Switchback experiments.**
        *   **Quasi-experiments.**

**Wikipedia:** [Design of experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  Why is randomization so important in experimental design?
2.  Describe some common threats to the validity of an experiment on a social media platform.
3.  How would you design an A/B test to measure the impact of a new feature that encourages users to connect with more friends? *Consider network effects.*
4.  What is a quasi-experiment, and when might you use one instead of a randomized controlled trial?

### SQL & Data Manipulation

SQL is the primary language for querying and manipulating data at Meta.  You'll be expected to write efficient and complex queries, often involving large datasets.  *Window functions and query optimization are critical skills.*

**Key Concepts:**

*   **SELECT, FROM, WHERE:** Basic query structure.
*   **JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL):**  Combining data from multiple tables. *Be able to explain the differences between join types and when to use each one.*
*   **GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX):**  Summarizing data.
*   **Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD, NTILE, AVG() OVER(), SUM() OVER()):** *Absolutely essential for Meta interviews.*  Performing calculations across rows related to the current row (e.g., calculating running totals, moving averages, ranking within groups).
*   **Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Creating reusable query blocks.
*   **Query Optimization:**  Writing efficient queries that minimize execution time.  Understanding how to use indexes, avoid full table scans, and optimize join order.
*   **UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT:** Set operators for combining results from multiple queries.

**Example SQL Problem (More Complex):**

Given two tables:

*   `users`: (user_id, signup_date, country)
*   `activity`: (user_id, activity_date, activity_type, time_spent)

Write a SQL query (using window functions) to find, for each country, the 7-day rolling average of *daily active users (DAU)* for the month of January 2024.  DAU is defined as the number of distinct users with any activity on a given day.

```sql
WITH DailyActivity AS (
    SELECT
        activity_date,
        country,
        COUNT(DISTINCT users.user_id) AS dau
    FROM activity
    JOIN users ON activity.user_id = users.user_id
    WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
    GROUP BY activity_date, country
),
RollingAvgDAU AS (
    SELECT
        activity_date,
        country,
        dau,
        AVG(dau) OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY activity_date ASC ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as rolling_avg_dau
    FROM DailyActivity
)
SELECT
    activity_date,
    country,
    dau,
	rolling_avg_dau
FROM RollingAvgDAU
ORDER BY country, activity_date;
```
**Explanation:**
1. **`DailyActivity` CTE:** Calculates DAU for each country on each date in January 2024.
2. **`RollingAvgDAU` CTE:**Uses a window function (`AVG() OVER()`) to calculate the 7-day rolling average. `PARTITION BY country` ensures the average is calculated separately for each country. `ORDER BY activity_date ASC` orders the data within each country by date. `ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` defines the 7-day window (current row + 6 preceding rows).
3. **Final SELECT Statement:**  The outer select query shows the date, country, dau and 7 day rolling average.

filtered_df = df[(df['country'] == 'USA') | (df['country'] == 'Canada')]

# 2. Create new column
filtered_df['session_duration_minutes'] = filtered_df['session_duration'] / 60

# 3. Calculate average session duration by country
avg_duration_by_country = filtered_df.groupby('country')['session_duration_minutes'].mean()
print(avg_duration_by_country)

# 4. Create histogram for USA users
usa_data = filtered_df[filtered_df['country'] == 'USA']
plt.hist(usa_data['session_duration_minutes'], bins=20)

## 3. Interview-Specific Preparation

This section dives into the different interview types you'll encounter.

### Technical Skills Interview (Coding/SQL)

This interview assesses your ability to write code to solve data-related problems.  Expect SQL-heavy questions, but be prepared to use Python/Pandas for data manipulation. *Communication is key.*

**How to Prepare:**

*   **Understand the Problem Thoroughly:**  Ask clarifying questions *before* you start coding.  Confirm your understanding of the requirements, edge cases, and constraints.
*   **Communicate Your Thought Process:** *Think out loud.* Explain your approach, justify your decisions, and discuss trade-offs. This is *crucial*, even if you don't arrive at the perfect solution immediately.
*   **Plan Your Approach:** Break down the problem into smaller subproblems.  Communicate your plan.
*   **Write Clean and Efficient Code:**  Pay attention to code readability, style, and efficiency.  Use meaningful variable names and comments.
*   **Consider Edge Cases:**  Think about how your code handles unusual inputs or scenarios.
*   **Time and Space Complexity:**  Be prepared to discuss the efficiency of your solution.
*   **Practice Extensively:**  Use the resources listed earlier (SQLZOO, HackerRank, StrataScratch, DataLemur, etc.).
*   **Mock Interviews:**  Practice coding interviews with friends or using platforms like Pramp.

**Common Analytical Patterns (with Examples):**

*   **Filtering and Aggregation:**
    *   SQL: \"Find the number of users who made a purchase in the last month, broken down by country.\"
    *   Python/Pandas: \"Calculate the average session duration for users who visited a specific page on the website.\"
*   **Joining and Combining Data:**
    *   SQL: \"Combine user demographic data with purchase history to find the top product categories purchased by users in each age group.\"
    *   Python/Pandas: \"Merge a DataFrame of user data with a DataFrame of product data to analyze product performance by user segment.\"
*   **Ranking and Ordering:**
    *   SQL: \"Rank users by their total spend in the last month and find the top 10%.\" (Use window functions!)
    *   Python/Pandas: \"Sort users by their engagement score and find the users with the highest engagement.\"
*   **Window Functions:**
    *   SQL: \"Calculate the day-over-day change in daily active users.\"
    *   SQL: \"Find the 7-day rolling average of new user sign-ups.\"
*   **Time Series Analysis:**
    *   SQL: \"Identify weeks with unusually high website traffic compared to the historical average.\"
    *   Python/Pandas: \"Calculate the month-over-month growth rate of user engagement.\"

**Example SQL Question (Advanced):**

(Same table structure as before: `users` and `activity`).  Write a SQL query to find, for each user, their *longest streak* of consecutive days with activity.

(This is a challenging problem that requires using window functions and recursive CTEs or a procedural approach, depending on the SQL dialect.) This example is more to *show* the *type* of complex problem you might encounter - it's likely beyond the scope of a typical interview, but it highlights the importance of mastering window functions and complex logic.

### Analytical Execution Interview (Case Study)

This interview assesses your ability to conduct quantitative analysis, draw meaningful conclusions, and communicate your findings effectively. You'll be given a business problem or dataset and asked to analyze it. *Structured thinking and clear communication are critical.*

**Key Areas:**

*   **Crafting Hypotheses and Statistical Knowledge:**  Formulating strong, testable hypotheses. Demonstrating a solid understanding of the statistical concepts covered earlier (LLN, CLT, regression, hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals).  *Be able to explain these concepts in plain language.*

    *   **Example Hypothesis (Feature Launch):** \"Launching a new 'Stories' feature will increase daily active users (DAU) by at least 5% within one month.\"
    *   **Example Hypothesis (Algorithm Change):** \"The new newsfeed algorithm will increase average user session duration without decreasing ad click-through rate (counter metric).\"

*   **Proficiency in Quantitative Analysis:**  Quantifying trade-offs, understanding the impact of features on metrics, and using data to support your arguments.

    *   **Example Quantification:** \"A 5% increase in CTR on 1 million impressions translates to 50,000 additional clicks. If the average revenue per click is $0.10, this represents a potential revenue increase of $5,000.\"

*   **Goal Setting Aligned with Business Objectives:** Defining clear goals and success metrics (KPIs) that contribute to broader business objectives.

    *   **KPI Framework (Success/Counter/Stability):**
        *   **Success Metrics:**  Directly measure the intended positive outcome. (e.g., Increase in DAU, increase in average session duration).
        *   **Counter Metrics:** Monitor for unintended negative consequences. (e.g., Decrease in ad click-through rate, increase in user reports of bugs).
        *   **Ecosystem Stability Metrics:** Ensure overall platform health. (e.g., Overall site load time, average number of posts per user, customer support ticket volume).

*   **Adapting Analytical Approaches in Dynamic Situations:**  Demonstrating flexibility when facing data challenges, changing requirements, or confounding factors.

    **Adapting Analytical Approaches in Dynamic Situations:** Demonstrating flexibility when facing data challenges, changing requirements, or confounding factors.

    *   **Example Scenarios & Adaptations:**

**Approach:**

1.  **Clarifying Questions:**
    *   \"Over what timeframe has the decline occurred?\"
    *   \"Is the decline observed across all regions/markets, or is it specific to certain areas?\"
    *   \"Is the decline observed across all user segments (e.g., age groups, new vs. existing users), or is it concentrated in specific segments?\"
    *   \"Have there been any recent product changes, algorithm updates, or marketing campaigns?\"
    *   \"Has there been a change in DAU/MAU metrics along with the decline in session duration?\"
    *   \"What are the specific business goals tied to user engagement (e.g., ad revenue, user growth)?\"

2.  **Define Metrics & Business Objectives:**
    *   **Metrics:** Average session duration (primary), DAU, MAU, content creation rate, interaction rate (likes, comments, shares).
    *   **Business Objectives:** Maintaining/increasing ad revenue, growing the user base, fostering a vibrant community.
    *   **KPIs:**
        *   **Success:** Increase average session duration by X%.
        *   **Counter:** Decrease in ad click-through rate, increase in user reports of bugs.
        *   **Stability:** Overall site load time, average number of posts per user.

3.  **Hypotheses:**
    *   H0: A recent algorithm change had no impact on average session duration.
    *   H1: The recent algorithm change led to a decrease in average session duration of more than Y%.
    *   *Other Hypotheses:*
        *   A competitor's new feature is attracting users away.
        *   There is a seasonal effect (e.g., users spend less time online during summer).
        *   A specific feature change is negatively impacting user experience.

4.  **Data Analysis Plan:**
    *   **Data Sources:** User activity logs, A/B test data (if applicable), demographic data, platform usage data.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Time series analysis to identify trends and patterns in session duration.
        *   Cohort analysis to compare the behavior of different user groups (e.g., users who joined before and after the algorithm change).
        *   Segmentation analysis to identify specific user segments that are experiencing the decline.
        *   Regression analysis to identify factors correlated with session duration.
        *   A/B testing to evaluate potential solutions.

5.  **Quantitative Analysis:**
    *   Calculate the magnitude of the decline in session duration.
    *   Quantify the impact of the decline on business metrics (e.g., potential ad revenue loss).
    *   If applicable, use A/B test data to estimate the impact of the algorithm change.

6.  **Recommendations & Trade-offs:**
    *   Based on the analysis, recommend actions to address the decline (e.g., revert the algorithm change, modify a specific feature, launch a new feature to re-engage users).
    *   Discuss potential trade-offs between different options (e.g., improving session duration might negatively impact another metric).

7.  **Next Steps:**
    *   Conduct further A/B testing to evaluate potential solutions.
    *   Monitor key metrics to track the impact of any changes.
    *   Continue to investigate the root cause of the decline.

*   **Ask Thoughtful Questions:** Prepare questions to ask your interviewers. This shows your interest and engagement.  Examples:
    *   **Recruiter Screen:** \"What are the biggest challenges facing the Data Science team at Meta right now?\"
    *   **Technical Interview:** \"What are the most common data sources and tools used by the team?\" \"Can you describe a recent project where the team used data to make a significant impact?\"
    *   **Analytical/Product Sense Interview:** \"How does the team collaborate with product managers and engineers?\" \"What are the key metrics the team is focused on improving?\"
    *   **Behavioral Interview:** \"What opportunities are there for professional development and growth within the Data Science team?\" \"How does Meta foster a culture of data-driven decision-making?\"
    *   **Hiring Manager:** \"What are your expectations for someone in this role in the first 30-60-90 days?\" \"What are the biggest opportunities for growth and impact on this team?\"
*   **Follow Up:** Send thank-you notes to your interviewers after each interview.
*   **Practice Mock Interviews:** *Essential!* Practice out loud and get feedback. Use platforms like Pramp or interview with peers.
*   **Learn from the Process:** Treat each interview as a learning experience. Reflect on your performance:
    *   What went well?
    *   What could I have done better?
    *   Were there any areas where I struggled?
    *   What topics do I need to review further?
* **Be Prepared to Explain Trade Offs, and Justify Your Choice.**
